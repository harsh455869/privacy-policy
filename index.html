  <h1>Privacy Policy for “How Are You”</h1>
  <p><strong>Last Updated:</strong> July 12, 2025</p>

  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p>
    “How Are You” (referred to as “we,” “us,” or “our”) is a chatbot app that lets users engage in conversations with fictional-style characters (e.g., “Tony,” “Steve”) not based on any real person, movie, or franchise. We respect your privacy and fully comply with Google Play’s 2025 Developer Program Policies and applicable data protection laws.
  </p>

  <h2>1. Developer Information & Contact</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Developer:</strong> afoxlife</li>
    <li><strong>Contact Email:</strong> <a href="mailto:afoxlife7@gmail.com">privacy@howareyouapp.com</a></li>
  </ul>
  <p>For any questions or data-related requests, please contact us.</p>

  <h2>2. Data Collection & Usage</h2>
  <p>
    We do <strong>not collect, store, or share any personal data or chat history</strong>. All conversation data remains only on your device.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Login:</strong> Login via Google or other social platforms is optional and skippable. If used, only your public profile name and avatar may be used for personalization—this information</li>
    <li><strong>No Permissions Required:</strong> Our app does not request or access any device permissions such as location, camera, microphone, or storage.</li>
    <li><strong>No External Data Sharing:</strong> We do not share any data with third parties, advertisers, or analytics platforms.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>3. Legal Basis & Consent</h2>
  <p>
    Since no personal or sensitive data is collected, stored, or transmitted, we do not require any consent for data processing. The app functions entirely on-device.
  </p>

  <h2>4. Data Security</h2>
  <p>
    As no data leaves the user’s device, there are no remote servers involved. Your data and chats remain private and secure on your own device.
  </p>

  <h2>5. Data Retention & Deletion</h2>
  <p>
    We do not retain any user data. All information, including chat history, remains local and is automatically removed when the app is uninstalled. No deletion request is required.
  </p>

  <h2>6. Children & Minors</h2>
  <p>
    The app is not intended for children under 13. We do not knowingly collect any personal information from children, in compliance with COPPA and Google Play Families Policy. Parental supervision is recommended for younger users.
  </p>

  <h2>7. Data Safety Disclosure</h2>
  <p>
    In our Google Play Data Safety form, we declare that:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>We do not collect or share any personal or sensitive user data.</li>
    <li>No permissions are required to use the app.</li>
    <li>The app functions fully offline, without sending data to any server.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>8. Updates to This Policy</h2>
  <p>
    We may occasionally update this policy to reflect app changes or legal updates. Any changes will be posted here, and the “Last Updated” date will be revised. For previous versions, please contact us.
