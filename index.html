  <h1>Privacy Policy for “How Are You”</h1>
  <p><strong>Last Updated:</strong> July 12, 2025</p>

  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p>
    “How Are You” (referred to as “we,” “us,” or “our”) is a chatbot app that lets users engage in conversations with fictional-style characters (e.g., “Tony,” “Steve”) not based on any real person, movie, or franchise. We value your privacy and fully comply with Google Play’s 2025 Developer Program Policies and applicable data protection laws.
  </p>

  <h2>1. Developer Information & Contact</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Developer:</strong> afoxlife</li>
    <li><strong>Contact Email:</strong> <a href="afoxlife7@gmail.com">privacy@howareyouapp.com</a></li>
  </ul>
  <p>For any questions or data-related requests, feel free to contact us.</p>

  <h2>2. Data Collection & Usage</h2>
  <p>
    We do <strong>not store any conversation or personal data on our servers</strong>. All chat history and interactions stay locally on your device.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Login:</strong> Users can log in using third-party social login (e.g., Google), but this is entirely optional and skippable. If used, only minimal public profile data (like name or avatar) is accessed for personalization, not stored on our servers.</li>
    <li><strong>Permissions:</strong> Runtime permissions (e.g., microphone for voice input) are used solely for core app functionality and not shared or stored.</li>
    <li><strong>Analytics:</strong> We may use anonymous usage analytics to understand general app performance and improve the experience. No personally identifiable data is collected.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>3. Legal Basis & Consent</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>All runtime permissions are requested with user consent.</li>
    <li>Analytics, if enabled, follow Google’s User Data & Data Safety policies and only use anonymized data.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>4. Data Security</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>No personal or chat data is transmitted to or stored on our servers.</li>
    <li>Any optional authentication or third-party integration is handled via secure, industry-standard protocols.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>5. Data Retention & Deletion</h2>
  <p>
    Since we do not store any user data, there's nothing retained on our end. All information remains on your device and can be cleared by uninstalling the app.
  </p>

  <h2>6. Children & Minors</h2>
  <p>
    Our app is not intended for children under 13. We do not knowingly collect personal data from minors in compliance with COPPA and Google Play’s Families Policy. Parents are encouraged to supervise use by younger users.
  </p>

  <h2>7. Data Safety Disclosures</h2>
  <p>
    In our Google Play Data Safety form, we disclose that:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>We may collect limited device information for performance monitoring only (e.g., crash logs).</li>
    <li>Data is not linked to any user identity and not used for advertising or profiling.</li>
    <li>No data is stored or shared externally beyond necessary anonymized technical reporting.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>8. Updates to This Policy</h2>
  <p>
    We may revise this Privacy Policy to reflect future changes. When we do, we’ll notify users via an in-app message and update the “Last Updated” date. For previous versions, please reach out to us.

      <li>Ensure the Play Console’s Data Safety form matches the privacy disclosures listed here.</li>
