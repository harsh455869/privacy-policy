  <h1>Privacy Policy for “How Are You”</h1>
  <p><strong>Last Updated:</strong> July 12, 2025</p>

  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p>
    “How Are You” (referred to as “we,” “us,” or “our”) is a chatbot app that allows users to have fictional-style conversations with imaginary characters (e.g., “Tony,” “Steve”), not based on any real person or brand. We respect your privacy and comply with Google Play’s 2025 Developer Program Policies and applicable data protection laws.
  </p>

  <h2>1. Developer Information & Contact</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Developer:</strong> afoxlife</li>
    
    <li><strong>Contact Email:</strong> <a href="mailto:afoxlife7@gmail.com">privacy@howareyouapp.com</a></li>
  </ul>

  <h2>2. Data Collection & Usage</h2>
  <p>
    The app can be used fully without creating an account. However, if users choose to log in using a third-party provider (e.g., Google,facebook), we collect and store basic profile data in Firebase. This includes:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Display name</li>
    <li>Email address</li>
    <li>Profile photo (if available)</li>
    <li>Unique Firebase user ID</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    This data is only used to personalize the app experience and allow users to sync their profile across devices. We do <strong>not store or access your chat data</strong> — all conversations remain entirely on your device.
  </p>
  <p><strong>Important:</strong> Login is optional and skipping login does not affect app functionality.</p>

  <h2>3. Permissions</h2>
  <p>
    Our app does <strong>not request or require any device permissions</strong> (e.g., camera, microphone, storage, location).
  </p>

  <h2>4. Legal Basis & Consent</h2>
  <p>
    We only collect data with your explicit consent — for example, when you choose to log in. No personal data is collected or stored without your action.
  </p>

  <h2>5. Data Security</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>All Firebase data is stored securely and protected by Google’s security infrastructure.</li>
    <li>We do not share your data with third-party advertisers or marketers.</li>
    <li>All communication with Firebase is encrypted using HTTPS/TLS.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>6. Data Retention & Deletion</h2>
  <p>
    You can request deletion of your stored profile data at any time by emailing us at <a href="mailto:privacy@howareyouapp.com">privacy@howareyouapp.com</a>. We will delete all associated data from Firebase within 30 days of your request.
  </p>
  <p>
    If you uninstall the app without logging in, no data is stored anywhere and deletion is automatic.
  </p>

  <h2>7. Children & Minors</h2>
  <p>
    Our app is not intended for users under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children, in compliance with COPPA and Google Play Families Policy. Parental guidance is recommended for younger users.
  </p>

  <h2>8. Data Safety Disclosure</h2>
  <p>As required by Google Play, we disclose that:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>We optionally collect basic user profile info via Firebase when login is used.</li>
    <li>No permissions are requested or required to use the app.</li>
    <li>All chat content stays on-device and is never uploaded or stored remotely.</li>
    <li>No data is used for advertising or tracking purposes.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>9. Updates to This Policy</h2>
  <p>
    We may update this Privacy Policy to reflect changes in our practices or legal requirements. When we do, we will notify users via in-app messages and update the “Last Updated” date at the top of this page.
  </p>
